\title{Watch the Tiger Walk: Another Study in Intention}
\author{Rachael Carlson}

\maketitle

\section{Introduction}
The twenty-first century musician is faced with a dilemma. The future
of the existence of the professional musician is uncertain. The
consumption of music seems to be at all-time highs and yet previous
sources of income are unreliable: the musician is no longer able to
rely on income from album sales, radio play and other royalties, sheet
music sales, or patronage. The twenty-first century musicians appears
to require all of these sources in order to make a living as a
professional musician. In addition to these sources of income, the
musician will need to find income from performances, instruction,
YouTube and other internet streaming services royalties,
and commissions from publications and magazines. \\

The finger-style guitarist is not immune to these changes. In some
cases, the finger-style guitarist is at the forefront of these
changes, a harbinger of the future. One of the earliest YouTube
celebrities was Andy McKee. This article will attempt to discern how
musicians are surviving, or even thriving, by examining their apparent
revenue streams. It will have three goals. First, to examine the
available methods of consuming a twenty-first century musician's
output. The aim for this examination is to establish a baseline by
which one can measure one's own progress in relation to those who have
achieved notoriety before him or her. The focus of this research will
primarily be on finger-style guitarists.  Second, to examine ``Watch
the Tiger Walk,'' an original composition, as a case study in which
the means examined in the first portion are fully or partially enacted
for a single composition. I will begin the necessary work on a
transcription and I will produce audio and video.  Third, I will begin
work on reinforcing my website in preparation for a life as a
professional musician and finger-style guitarist.

\section{Internet Presence}
\label{sec:internet-presence}
There are numerous ways in which a twenty-first century musician
supports herself. The most visible component of this support is the
internet. A musician is judged upon her social presence on the
internet.

\subsection{The Data}
\label{sec:data}
The parameters for the research are as follows: finger-style
guitarist, a website, some level of notoriety. I also gave
consideration to whether the artist is established or up-and-coming,
ultimately deciding to focus roughly half of each group. 41 artist
websites were analyzed. 21 artists could be considered up-and-coming
and 20 could be considered established. The original intention was to
include artists outside of the finger-style sphere, however, the data
set quickly became too immense and it was necessary to exclude artists
outside of finger-style guitar. It may be beneficial in the future to
take a more inclusive approach to this research in order to inform the
twenty-first century finger-style guitarist. A concerted effort was
made to include musicians outside of the United States. There appears
to be a tendency among burgeoning artists to rely on Facebook to share
their craft.

Through an analysis of a subsample of the data, 26 codes were
developed. The codes were carefully selected to demonstrate important
elements of an artist's website. The codes fell into roughly four
categories: persona, display, technologies, and commerce. These codes
range from the manner in which the artist attested to his or her
legitimacy to the type of Content Management System (\textsc{cms})
that the artist uses.

This data is a snapshot of the immense world of finger-style guitar as
it exists on the internet. The rapid changes in technology may deem
this essay obsolete quite soon. This data set has been included in
the appendix.

\subsection{Analysis}
\label{sec:analysis}

There were several codes which fall into a subjective field of
determination. These were the claims to legitimacy, visual display,
and the openness of the artist to her craft. The content of these
codes was based upon
\begin{table}
  \centering
  \small
  \begin{tabular}{p{0.27\linewidth}p{0.15\linewidth}p{0.45\linewidth}}\toprule
    Claim to Legitimacy & Number of artists & Description \\\midrule
    Associative & 1 & artists with whom artist associates \\
    Freshness & 1 & a new face in the finger-style scene \\
    Historical & 3 & in the context as an artist \\
    Inspirational & 1 & a story which inspires legitimacy \\
    Instructional & 3 & through their abilities as teachers \\
    Material & 2 & sponsorships or instruments \\
    Musical & 15 & audio and video presentations \\
    No claims & 4 & artist makes no overt claim to legitimacy \\
    Testimonial & 13 & reviews of artist by artists and other entities \\
    Youthfulness & 1 & age of artist is claim to legitimacy \\
      \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{The array of claims to legitimacy.}
\end{table}
the subjective interpretation of the author. A major component of the
artists' web sites is how the artist establishes his or her legitimacy
as a performer and/or composer. Some artists claimed several different
types of legitimacy at the same time. For instance, Pierre Bensusan's
web site claims his legitimacy through his musicality and through
sponsorships. His sponsorships have been coded as a claim to
legitimacy through material means. Another example of an artist
claiming legitimacy through material means would be Alex Anderson, who
makes a point to associate himself with the harp guitar. Another
subject code was the appearance of the artist's web site. All of the
artist web sites had pictures of the artist on the landing, or home,
page. Some artists had color schemes which made the text
illegible. The different visual displays that are utilized by
finger-style guitarists span the last twenty years of graphic design
on the internet. Some artists are closed about their art in that they
do not display any indication that they are willing to teach someone
their craft. Other artists are open about their art. Those that are
open are open in different ways. Ewan Dobson and Mike Dawes offer
lessons over Skype.

  \vspace{6pt}
  \caption{Yes-or-no questions asked of the artists' websites.}
\end{margintable}

Several questions, ranging from visual to technical, were coded for
each web site. While it may have seemed arbitrary at first to ask some
of the questions listed in Table 2, the responses can be quite
surprising. For instance, a little under half of the web sites were
not friendly to mobile browsers. This is perhaps indicative of a lag
between changes in the display of finger-style guitarists' web sites
and worldwide trends in internet browsing. As seen in Figure 1, around
October of 2016, the market share of mobile browsers surpassed that of
desktop browsers. It may be wise for all finger-style guitarists, as
well as content producers in general, to recognize the importance of
creating an adequate user experience for the mobile platform.

  \label{fig:StatCounter2}
\end{figure}
The result of not making one's web site friendly to mobile users is
lessened when one examines the market share for only the United States
of America, seen in Figure 2. Four web sites require Adobe Flash in
order to experience content. These four web sites are leaving at least
half of the users of the internet in the dark as Adobe has
discontinued Flash development for mobile
platforms.\autocite{adobeFlash} It is also quite surprising that only
half of the artists have streaming audio on their web sites while
every artist except six have streaming video. This may be an
indication of the near-ubiquity of streaming video on the internet. It
would have been interesting to see the shift from streaming audio to
streaming video in the 2000s. \emph{Internet Archive}'s
``WaybackMachine'' may be a way in which to examine the developments
of finger-style guitarists' web sites through the
years.\autocite{internetArchive}

  \caption{Distribution of discernable Content Management Systems among the
    web sites of finger-style guitarists.} 
\end{margintable}
An area of particular interest to me was the manner in which these web
sites managed their content. I was able to determine the Content
Management Systems (\textsc{cms}) of 23 sites as seen in Table 3. The
most represented \textsc{cms} is Squarespace with 7 artists followed
by Bandzoogle at 4 and Wix at 3. I find this interesting because some
of these \textsc{cms}'s integrate components into their systems which
may assist an artist in the management of his or her web site. For
instance, Bandzoogle assists in creating mobile-friendly web sites
with a web store, newsletters, streaming services, blogs, and a gig
calendar.\autocite{bandzoogle} The web sites which did not have any
discernible manner in which to determine content creation may or may
not have been created and managed with a \textsc{cms}.

One of the primary catalysts for this essay was to conduct a review of
the distribution of sheet music within a digital finger-style
domain. Almost every web site delivered their transcriptions in a
different way. A few sites, such as Pierre Bensusans' had what
appeared to be a custom built store. Others, such as Gareth Pearson,
linked out to other venues such as CandyRat or Bandcamp. Many artists
sold their products through PayPal in which the site redirected the
customer to PayPal to make his or her purchase. Several sites,
including Alex de Grassi's, delivered through a storefront created by
their \textsc{cms}.

Each difference in web site delivery can either enhance or detract
from the user experience. This essay is a survey not discussion of
expected graphical design components of a finger-style guitarist's web
site.
\section{Transcription}
A distinguishing characteristic of the finger-style
guitarist's website is a section of sheet music, scores, or
transcriptions of the artist's works. This seems to be a unique
component of the finger-style culture. Sadly, while the transcriptions
are becoming marginally better than ansi-tab on the internet, the
quality of the transcriptions produced by these musicians is not on
par with the quality of playing or composition. This could be
attributed to different factors, all of which are for another
essay. Here I will discussed near-best practices for the production of
finger-style transcriptions.
\subsection{Methods}
\label{sec:methods}
The primary method espoused by the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee
(\textsc{uwm}) and Stropes Editions, Ltd. (\textsc{sel}) is a
double-impression method utilizing Finale and Adobe InDesign. The
methods in this document are as follows: {\XeLaTeX} for the
typesetting of this essay and the same double-impression method of
Finale and Adobe InDesign used by \textsc{sel} and \textsc{uwm} for
the transcription.

\subsection{Typography}
\label{sec:typography}
The fonts used at \textsc{sel} are Helvetica \textsc{lt} Std, \textsc{itc}
Franklin Gothic and occasionally Times New Roman. Due to the innovations in finger-style guitar typesetting by this company, it can be difficult to reach beyond the conventions established. I am reminded of a quote by the highly influential designer, Paul Rand, ``new becomes threatening, the old reassuring.''
\begin{figure*}\centering
        \includegraphics[width=1.00\textwidth]{watchTheTigerWalk20170326.pdf}
    \caption{``Watch the Tiger Walk'' by Rachael Carlson, mm. 1--2.}
    \label{fig:somthing}
  \end{figure*}
  While the design of the \textsc{sel} sheet music would not be
  considered bad, in fact they stand apart from all previous
  transcriptions in their beauty, they \emph{have} established
  themselves as reassuring. It can be quite difficult to produce a
  score for finger-style guitar which does not either copy
  \textsc{sel} or fall into the category of ugly music for the
  guitar. The difficulty of producing a unique voice within the field
  of music engraving is perhaps due to this feeling of reassurance. We
  are tasked with the necessity of simultaneously producing documents
  that are almost audible in their beauty and ensuring the maximum
  level of legibility. Established music publishers such as
  Bärenreiter and Henle Verlag may have specific guidelines to produce
  a base-level of legibility. Perhaps, the requirement of legibility
  at a specific distance from the page in order to anticipate
  real-world scenario of music reading.

  I have carefully chosen the typography of my transcriptions. And
  while I wish that I could say that I have found the perfect
  combination, I can not. What I can say, is that the typography that
  I have chosen for my transcriptions is designed for optimal
  legibility at small font sizes while ensuring the reader will not
  confuse one glyph for another.

      \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
    \caption{Weights and sizes of fonts used in my transcriptions.}
\end{table}
Fonts that are designed based upon Claude Garamont (c. 1510 -- 1561)
and Robert Granjon (1513 -- 1590) speak to me. Both Garamont and
Granjon were French type designers and publishers in France. EB
Garamond is an open source project directed by Georg Duffner based
upon the \emph{Berner specimen}. This specimen does not contain bold
examples. As such, neither does EB Garamond. The default numerical
figures used in EB Garamond are old-style. Due to this I use Adobe
Garamond Pro for titling which contains numbers and for the clef which
looks more attractive in a bold typeface. On the complete opposite end
of the Garamond spectrum, for the noteheads and the left-hand
fingering I use Google's Noto Sans. This font family was designed for
the mobile market as a means to ensure that almost all of the more
than 128,000 figures in \emph{The Unicode Standard} are present such
than when a user is confronted with a glyph they do not see a white
box affectionately called a block of tofu.

There must to be a time when one makes a decision knowing all of the
positives and negatives associated with that decision. It is at this
point that it is more important that one makes \emph{a} decision than
whether that decision is the best possible decision. I have vacillated
between ten or so different fonts for my transcriptions. The decision
of which font combination ensures readability while expressing an
individual voice. This is an extremely difficult set of decisions. If
I had enough money to purchase fonts I would most likely use
\emph{Garamond Premier Pro} from Adobe and \emph{Whitney} from Hoefler
\& Company.\autocites{garamondPremier,hoeflerWhitney} I am attracted
to \emph{Whitney} in particular due to the presence of the ``Index''
font subset which contains circled numbers and letters ---
{\symbolfont① ② ③ ④ Ⓣ}. My attraction to \emph{Garamond Premier Pro}
based on the same discussion above about Gararmont and Granjon while
\emph{Garamond Premier Pro} is also a massive font family of 34
different fonts each with a different purpose. This versatility is an
extremely attractive feature of a font which will be used to set body
copy for study notes and the other ancillary elements of professional
sheet music.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

\newthought{There can only be one} conclusion to an essay such as
this: there is no conclusion. The technologies involved in
constructing both web sites and finger-style transcriptions is in a
constant state of development. The prevalence of the mobile platform
has become near-ubiquitous within the last five years. The manner in
which finger-style guitar transcriptions are produced has changed
drastically in the last twenty years. The software that is available
to produce finger-style guitar transcriptions are at the users
fingertips, a mere download away. While this software may not produce
professional-grade transcriptions on the same level as an \textsc{sel}
transcription, they have helped begin the process of taking guitar
tablature out of the dark ages of ansi-tab. It is not possible to
conclude how the future of finger-style guitar is going pan out. What
\emph{can} be concluded is that it is incredible to be a finger-style
guitarist in an age in which finger-style guitar is experiencing a
renaissance. There is a distinct possibility that someone I know may
come across or benefit greatly from some new technology that cannot be
imagined.
