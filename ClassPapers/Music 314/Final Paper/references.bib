@article{kenny2008,
	Abstract = {Because English solo songs from the Golden Age period (c.1600-20) are chiefly familiar from printed books clearly intended for domestic use, modern scholars and performers have tended to assume that composers had the literary interests, practical needs and technical limitations of upper-class amateurs in mind right from the start of the creative process. According to this view, lute ayres are the musical equivalents of early 17th-century miniature portraits: objets d'art for personal contemplation (the self-accompanying singer) or special sharing with special friends. This article explores the lute song repertory from a different angle, as the domesticated tip of a professional and (at the time) a publicly appreciable iceberg much of which melted away with the professional performers originally responsible for its semi-improvisatory effectiveness. The manuscript Oxford, Christ Church Mus.439 is studied in particular{\^a}a source with probable professional provenance, preserving some highly ornamented versions of songs now much better known in their plainer printed versions and (at the other extreme) some songs from which the fully written-out lute parts familiar from the printed books have been removed. 'What sorts of alternative were improvised in their place? While lute song publishers assumed a 'minimalist aesthetic' and sensibly encouraged their customers to do the same, lute song composers were aware of other possibilities and those with a theatrical leaning (Campion, Rosseter, Johnson, for instance) might even have preferred them. Today's historically informed performers have a wider range of interpretative choice legitimately open to them than perhaps they realize.},

@article{fabian2001,
	Abstract = {The concept of authenticity in musical performance has been debated extensively in British-American musicology during the 1980s and 1990s mostly in the context of early music and historical performance practice. What is missing from these publications is an acknowledgment and integration of research of the issue by European scholars and performers, which occurred some 20 years earlier. The current paper provides a comprehensive review of this earlier literature on authenticity and its meaning as it unfolded during the period from the 1950s to the late 1970s. It demonstrates that many of the claims put forward by English and American scholars in the 1980s were neither new nor fair towards certain performers associated with the movement. For instance, several of the concerns expressed by Taruskin had already been declaimed by Continental writers such as Finscher and artists like Harnoncourt. The research also shows that the indiscriminate use of the word 'authentic' in journalistic and promotional publications provided the real basis for criticism because certain leading scholars and performers have always regarded authenticity in musical performance as a chimera.},

@article{impett1998,
	Abstract = {This article explores the idea of "authenticity" in musical practice as a function of its situatedness in technology. Two recent developments of the trumpet are discussed-the reinvention of the baroque trumpet and the author's design and use of a computer-extended trumpet (the metatrumpet)-to highlight issues of historical, personal and cultural authenticity. It is suggested that an appropriate understanding of the technology of a given culture is necessary for the "authentic" expression of that culture. Texts by Lyotard and Adorno illuminate an exploration of the nature and practice of contemporary music technology. The integration of subject and material, and the redefinition of the relationship between "composed" and "performed" time in music, are identified as essential and relevant properties of this technology.},

@article{shull2006,
	Abstract = {This study examines the philosophies, values and ethics of Early Music performers who use living musics to inform and enhance their performance styles and techniques. Early Music performers seek to revive lost traditions of performance, relying on spare descriptions and fragmentary evidence. Since the 1950s, several generations of visionary performers have turned to living musical traditions for inspiration and collaboration in the recreation of earlier European repertoires. Early Music specialists who follow this path hold their informants and collaborators in high esteem and treat their beliefs with respect. They often avoid surface aspects of the musics on which they draw, instead favouring large-scale structural features and performance techniques from which they can develop models for their own work. While many have criticized this approach as an appeal to the exotic and as an extension of 19th-century orientalizing projects, few scholarly studies have sought to understand it from the point of view of the musicians themselves. Ethnography in the field of Early Music -- in conjunction with the published writings of the musicians -- provides a valuable perspective on this living art. Western classical music in general is under-represented in ethnomusicological research and deserves sympathetic, though not necessarily uncritical, ethnographies. Collaborative projects between historical musicologists and ethnomusicologists on the place of past music in the present would benefit both fields.},

@article{ornoy2006,
	Abstract = {Examination of the mode of performance of central musical parameters was carried out through comparative analysis of a selection of recorded performances of Baroque compositions, made by prominent 'historically informed' and 'main stream' performers of different periods. Analysis of the manner of execution of pitch, intonation, tempo, rhythmic interpretation and ornamentation was aimed at exploring performance conventions, canonic authorities and the degree of compliance to scholarly findings and directives made in regards to these parameters. Results suggest the existence of ruling conventional practices and fixed prototypes of interpretations. Comparison between the 'historically informed' group of performers and their 'main stream' colleagues has shown clear similarity in many of the analyzed parameters, suggesting the existence of mutual influences and shared canonic authorities. Different degrees of compliance have been additionally found between scholarly directives and performances made in 'real' practice: despite some exceptions traced in various cases, findings have shown inclination towards 'traditional' positions stated by earlier scholars while later, critical attitudes did not find their way to general practice.},

	Abstract = {This article analyses the ongoing debate with respect to the vocal scoring of Bach's cantatas. A content analysis of written accounts and a consecutive hierarchical class analysis reveals commonalities and divergences. It becomes clear that adherence to historical sources does not necessarily lead to a 'one-to-a-part' interpretation, even within the community of historically informed performance practitioners. As such, the findings reveal the similarities with search and creation processes documented in innovation studies. While bounded by respect for historical sources, the processes underlying the genesis of a novel performance of Baroque music clearly imply the distinctive, creative role of performers.

	Abstract = {Evidence is presented contrary to widely held assumptions about all-vocal performance of French chansons written before 1500. While some of these concepts have long been known---the linear character of individual lines, and the different nature of the contratenor---the authors bring new evidence to bear on the question: harmonic anomalies and the occurrence of multiple notes. The fact that all three types of evidence here are found only in the contratenor part recalls an old concept, much disparaged in the recent literature, known as the 'English a cappella heresy': that the contratenor of the late 15th century, in the hands of Antoine Busnoys and his contemporaries---including much of the music of the five central Loire valley chansonniers---appears to have been created for performance on a plucked string instrument.},
