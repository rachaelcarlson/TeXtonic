\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
Of the easily accessible articles on the subject, there are two
primary discussions that can be analyzed: first, the debate between
whether or not early 15th-century chansons were written with
instrumental accompaniment; second, two major definitions of the word
\emph{authenticity} as it relates to early music performance. I would
imagine that once one digs deeper into the literature there are
debates about the specific performance practices of different genres,
regions, and instruments. As such, this paper will primarily focus on
the definitions of authenticity forwarded by individuals such as
Richard Taruskin and John Butt in the 1980s through the 2000s
only. This literature review ended up relying heavily on Michael Troy
Murphy's dissertation from 2008 on the recordings of J.S. Bach's
\emph{Passio Secundum Johannem}.\autocite{murphy2008}

Murphy traces the interest the performance of historical music from
Mozart arranging Bach and Handel, to Dannreuther Dolmetsch in the
early twentieth century, to the founding in 1933 of the Schola
Cantorum Basiliensis in Switzerland, to contemporary scholarship on
performing historical music.\autocite[9--16]{murphy2008} Murphy notes
that Dorottya Fabian, in ``The Meaning of Authenticity and the Early
Music Movement,'' comes to the ``conclusion that musicians and
scholars in continental Europe came to regard `authenticity' as a
futile utopian attempt fifteen years before English speaking
countries.''\autocite[23]{murphy2008}


% \section{Heresy}
% \label{sec:heresy}
% A major discussion occurred in the 1990s surrounding the performance of 15th
% Century chansons. The major individuals discussing this were
% Slavin\autocite{slavin1991} and Urquhart\autocite{urquhart2011}.

\section{Issues of Authenticity: Taruskin vs. Butt}
\label{sec:auth-vs.-inform}

In 1982, Taruskin wrote that we ``tend to assume that if we can
recreate all the external conditions that obtained in the original
performance of a piece we will thus recreate the composer's inner
experience of the piece and thus allow him to speak for
himself.''\autocite[341]{taruskin1982} Taruskin states that
authenticity in ``performance practice is a chimaera, most of us are
nevertheless no more deterred by this realization from seeking it than
was Bellerophon himself.''\autocite[341]{taruskin1982} The essence of
Taruskin's thought on the subject in 1982 seems to be: ``it's find to
assemble the shards of a lost performance tradition, but how much
better to reinvent it.''\autocite[343]{taruskin1982} In speaking of
the most authoritative performances he asserts that they ``have always
been those that have proceeded from a vividly imagined---that is
frankly to say imaginary---but coherent performance style. They
provide themselves with Tradition \ldots and bestow authenticity upon
themselves.''\autocite[343]{taruskin1982} These performances are not
truly reconstructions of past performances, ``they are
quintessentially modern performances, modernist performances in fact,
the product of an esthetic wholly of our own era, no less time-bound
than the performance styles they would
supplant.''\autocite[344]{taruskin1982} At the end of this article,
Taruskin quotes an analogy for the musicologist from Nikolai Malko in
which the musicologist is like a cook who only talks about the making
of eggs instead of actually making them. After this Taruskin states
that in reference to those eggs, ``we're eating them now, and even
cook up a few on occasion, as when we do a little discreet composing
to make a fragmentary piece performance. Now, if we could only sell
them\ldots''\autocite[349]{taruskin1982} This is an extremely
interesting statement. It references a form of authenticity that Kivy
mentions later in 1995, the `sensible authenticity' in which the
audience decides their own form of authenticity.\autocite{kivy1995}

Laurence Dreyfus, in his 1983 article, ``Early Music Defended Against
its Devotees'', discusses Theodor Adorno's thoughts on early music
performance and the developing aesthetic relationship between the
emerging avant garde and early music. Dreyfus's article also attempts
to examine many of the emerging connections within early music. One
distinct way that he does this is through what he calls a Brechtian
table in which he defines the different roles of Early Music against
the Musical Mainstream.\autocite[317--318]{dreyfus1983} This table has
been printed below.

  Early Music\\
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item The conductor is banished.
  \item All members of the ensemble are equal.
  \item Ensemble members play a number of instruments, sometimes sing, and commonly exchange roles.
  \item Symptomatic grouping: the consort---like-minded members of a harmonious family.
  \item Virtuosity is not a set goal and is implicitly discouraged.
  \item Technical level of professionals is commonly mediocre.
  \item The audience (often amateurs) may play the same repertory at home.
  \item The audience identifies with the performers.
  \item Programs are packed with homogeneous works and are often dull.
  \item Critics report on the instruments, the composers, pieces and that ``a good time was had by all.''
    \end{enumerate}
    \columnbreak
    Musical Mainstream\\
    \begin{enumerate}
  \item The conductor is the symbol of authority, stature, and social difference.
  \item The orchestra is organized in a hierarchy.
  \item The ``division of labor'' is strictly defined, with one player per part.
  \item Symptomatic grouping: the concerto---opposing forces struggling for control; later, the one against the many.
  \item Virtuosity defines the professional.
  \item Technical standards are high and competitive.
  \item The audience marvels at the technical demands of the repertory.
  \item The audience idealizes the performers.
  \item Programs contain contrasting items and are designed around a climax.
  \item Critics comment on the performer and his interpretation.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{multicols}

In Taruskin's next article on the subject of authenticity, he notes
that performers see musical performance as texts. He notes that
``many, if not most, of use who concern ourselves with `authentic'
interpretation of music approach musical performance with the
attitudes of textual critics, and fail to make the fundamental
distinction between music as tones-in-motion and music as
notes-on-page.''\autocite[4]{taruskin1984} This discussion of
performer as textual critic is placed in opposition to the performer
as moral philosopher. I must add this excellent quote which has bearing on finger-style guitar:
\begin{quote}
  So where does one begin? Surely with the music, with one's love for
  it, with endless study of it, and with the determination to
  challenge one's every assumption about it, especially the
  assumptions we do not know we are making because, to quote
  Whitehead, `no other way of putting things has ever occurred' to us
  \ldots One Musician whom I particularly admire, a lutenist, once
  told me that when he began to experiment with improvisation
  practices to accompany medieval song, he deliberately
  mistuned[\emph{sic}] his instrument so that his fingers would not be
  able to run along familiar paths.\autocite[10]{taruskin1984}
\end{quote}
It is curious to think of the early music performer as sharing
characteristics with the 21st-century finger-style guitarist. In a
segment which Kivy might deem a discussion on `sonic authenticity,'
Taruskin notes that using old instruments forces the performer into a
space of unfamiliarity which forces her ``into a more direct confrontation with the music.''\autocite[11]{taruskin1984}

1995 page 166.\autocite[166]{taruskin1995}

Kivy ``proposes there are four'' authenticities.\autocite{kivy1995} As
discussed in Murphy, there is the `composer authenticity,' the `sonic
authenticity,' the `personal authenticity,' and the `sensible
authenticity.'\autocite[26]{murphy2008} The first deals with composer
intent, the second, sonic, is concerned with ``reconstructing the
physical materials'' surrounding a given composition's inception, the
third, personal, deals with the performer sense of authenticity, the
fourth, sensible, deals with how the audience interacts with
authenticity.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

Like most of the work that I have done this semester, I find myself
biting off more than I can chew, as it were. This project demanded
more time of me than I was able to give. It is a worthwhile
subject. In a different world, I would have worked more with recent
dissertations on the performance of early music. I also would have
been interested in focusing on thoughts on early music performance
surrounding plucked-string instruments, such as lutes and historical
guitars. It appears that these discussions have been written about in
journals such as \emph{Performance Practice Review} and \emph{Early Music}.
