% Several of this week's readings (Kristen, McSweeney, Ross) deal with
% the question of gender representation in the programming practices
% of art music institutions. In the discourse that these readings are
% drawn from, one of the key debates is over the methods that could be
% used to change the existing paradigms. Two of the most commonly
% asserted solutions are 1) to purposefully and aggressively program
% composers from underrepresented populations or 2) to focus on
% program newer music, with the assumption that the statistics with
% will even out based on the changing demographics of the pool of
% composers.

% Referring to specific ideas from these readings, briefly respond to
% this discourse, taking a stance if you have one, or outlining the
% key arguments in play.

Ross and Kirsten seem to be on the same page in regards to the
programming of new music and that music's relationship to gender. They
take the stance that if more new music is presented in classical/art
music venues I am not on this page.
