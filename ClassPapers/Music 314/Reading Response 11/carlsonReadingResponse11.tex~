\noindent Reading Response 11\\
\noindent Music 314\\

% Several of this week's readings (Kristen, McSweeney, Ross) deal with
% the question of gender representation in the programming practices
% of art music institutions. In the discourse that these readings are
% drawn from, one of the key debates is over the methods that could be
% used to change the existing paradigms. Two of the most commonly
% asserted solutions are 1) to purposefully and aggressively program
% composers from underrepresented populations or 2) to focus on
% program newer music, with the assumption that the statistics with
% will even out based on the changing demographics of the pool of
% composers.

% Referring to specific ideas from these readings, briefly respond to
% this discourse, taking a stance if you have one, or outlining the
% key arguments in play.

\noindent Ross and Kirsten seem to be on the same page in regards to
the programming of new music and that music's relationship to
gender. They take the stance that if more new music is presented in
classical/art music venues the inequality of representation within the
world of new music will work itself out. I am not on this page. I wish
that this page was possible. I hope that we will find it to be
true. Especially given my desire for new works to be presented more
often than the oldies. I think that Ambrose's article straddles the
line between the two discourses noted in the prompt. It seems to me
that Ambrose is attempting to reveal the discrepancies between how a
woman is treated in an interview and how a man would be treated in a
similar interview. It seems to me that Ambrose's article is
essentially about how women are tokenized in an interview setting.

I think that both discourses can be reduced in the following way: 1)
recognition of gender identity and 2) denial of gender identity. These
discourses remind me of the discourses around race, namely, critical
race theory and colorblindness. The first asserts that race, though it
is a social construct, is fundamental to how people experience the
world; the second asserts that in a post-civil rights world, invoking
race serves no purpose, we have equality.
