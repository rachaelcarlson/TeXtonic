\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
The world of finger-style is faced with a beautiful problem: there is
currently only one university program in the world which offers a
bachelor's level degree in finger-style guitar. It is beautiful
because there is a program which has the foresight to offer a
program. It is a problem because the fate of finger-style guitar in
the university is intimately intertwined with the success of this
program and its graduates. From an extreme viewpoint, this program
could be viewed as either the catalyst for the flourishing of
finger-style in the university or the death knell for finger-style
guitar. The intention of this paper is to establish a foundation upon
which a proposal for a similar finger-style guitar program at a
university can be built. This proposal can take many forms. I will be
examining numerous possibilities for how a proposal could be constructed.

This topic is massive. This paper is a personal journey and it can be
reflected in the language used in this paper. I am not going to be
able to address each detail of a proposal to a university. While
conducting the research for this paper, my aims shift, my tactics
change. For instance, after speaking with Michael Chapdelaine, my
vision of the future has changed. I plan on redoubling my efforts as a
performer/composer as my avenue by which I may enter academia as a
finger-style guitar instructor. Such changes as this are not to be
viewed as hindrances to the completion of a paper. They are deeply
related to the purpose of this paper.

\section{Tactics}
\label{sec:tactics}
This section will examine the different manners in which it seems, to
me at least, that I might be able to convince a university to offer or
reveal the importance of offering an undergraduate degree in
finger-style guitar performance. The first is to situate the
instrument and its manner of performance within its contexts as a way
to show the historical significance of the style. Second, I will
attempt to look at how the style is existing in the present and how it
might exist in the future as a way to anticipate its future
successes. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, I will discuss
different ways in which I can development as a performer, composer,
and scholar as a means to establish my own significance in relation to
the style. I deem these to be tactics which I should have in my back
pocket, if you will, in case I am ever in a situation in which I might
need to demonstrate the significance of the style or of myself.
\subsection{Situation}
\label{sec:situation}
This tactic takes two forms: first, the history of the guitar; second,
the history of finger-style guitar as a genre of music.
