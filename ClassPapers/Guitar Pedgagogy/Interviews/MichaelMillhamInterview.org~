J: wonderful! Very nice to see you. Rachael Carlson here.

R: Hello. Nice to meet you.

J: Michael, I know that we have a lot to catch up on. Didn't we talk about 20 or 30 years ago. 

M: Yeah, I think that's about right.

J: Yeah. How have you been in the mean time?

M: Playing guitar and well.

J: Good

M: And plenty of it.

J: I still run into Dan Schwartz. In fact, he was just sending me some text messages this morning.

M: Dan is a long time friend, for sure.  

J: He's a good guy. We've got a guitar builder, Jason Kostal, who's coming into town. He just build a guitar for Willie Porter apparently.
