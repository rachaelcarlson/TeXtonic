* Outline
** Purpose
The purpose of this project is to attempt to ready myself for life outside
the university. One of the goals of this project is to help me spend as little
time outside as possible. In producing this paper, I attempt to anticipate the
components of a proposal for a finger-style guitar program which would most
likely entice or convince an institution of higher education of the importance
of offering such a program.
** Tactics
*** Situation
Situate finger-style guitar within its context by providing a detailed survey
of the history of the guitar.

** History
** Interviews
*** With whom?
** Elevators
** Conclusion
