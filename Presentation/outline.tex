ERROR: I can't find file `<none>.tex'.

--- TeX said ---
! I can't find file `<none>.tex'.
--- HELP ---
TeX can't find a file that it needs. If the name of the missing file
has the extension tex, then it is looking for an input file that you
specified---either your main file or another file inserted with an
\input or \include command. If the missing file has the extension sty
, then you have specified a nonexistent document style or style
option.
